      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a data scientist with a background in statistics and machine learning. I enjoy solving real-world problems using clean code, math, and data.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Route Optimizer:</strong> Coded a program that takes in <i>n</i> user-inputted addresses, and finds the quickest route that stops at all of them. A web-based version is available <a href="route_optimizer.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>Real-time traffic data was received using the tomtom API</li>
            <li>Geopy was used to geocode the addresses. Folium was used to draw the generated route on a map</li>
            <li>Dijkstra's algorithm was utilized to calculate the shortest path between nodes</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bevbot!:</strong> Built a robot that tracks hand-movement within a camera frame, using a stepper motor and linear actuator to pitch and yaw the camera, and fires a canned beverage at the hand from across the room using an air compressor and pneumatic piston through voice activation.
          <ul>
            <li>Software is coded in Python using OpenCV and Pyfirmata</li>
            <li>Electronics (stepper motor, solenoid valve, custom PCBs) driven by an Arduino Uno microcontroller </li>
            <li>Powered by a 48 V power supply, 12 V motorcycle batteries and a 20 V Li-ion battery</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Concrete Compressive Strength:</strong> Created a machine learning model in Python using Scikit-learn to predict concrete compressive strength from a set of measured variables
          <ul>
            <li>Used variable selection (PCA, factor analysis, CCA), multiple linear regression, clustering, cross-validation</li>
            <li>Used gradient boosting and random forest algorithms to predict compressive strength</li>
            <li>Helped develop skills for applying machine learning algorithms to real-world data sets </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
